# OpenComplex2
OpenComplex2 (OC2) is a generative foundation model that bridges static structure prediction and dynamic ensemble modeling of biomolecular systems. Unlike traditional structure prediction methods that focus solely on a single conformation, OC2 can efficiently sample thermodynamically relevant conformational ensembles, providing insights into molecular function that static structures alone cannot capture.
